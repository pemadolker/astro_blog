# Introduction

Enumeration is a commonly used term in cybersecurity. It basically means gathering information about a target using both **active methods** (like scanning) and **passive methods** (like using third-party sources). It's important to remember that **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** is a **separate process**—it only involves passive info gathering and doesn’t include the active enumeration part.

Enumeration is more like a **loop**. As we discover more data, we use that to dig deeper and gather even more. We can get information from places like domains, IP addresses, services, ports, and many other sources.

Once we know what our target is—usually parts of a client's infrastructure—we start looking at the specific services and protocols running. These services are usually what make the communication between the business, its customers, and staff possible.

Let’s say we’ve been hired to check the IT security of a company. Before diving into attacks, we should **first understand how the company works**—what services they use, which third-party vendors are involved, what kind of security they have in place, etc.

This part is where many people get it wrong. Instead of trying to understand how everything works together, they go straight to attacking obvious things. Like, finding SSH, RDP, or WinRM and jumping into brute-force attacks. But brute-forcing is noisy and can get you blocked quickly, especially if you don’t understand the defensive measures the company has set up.

The point of enumeration is **not** to “hack in” straight away. The goal is to find **all the possible ways** to get in.

Think of it like this: imagine you're a treasure hunter. You wouldn’t just grab a shovel and start digging randomly. You’d study maps, plan your route, get the right tools, and understand the land first. If you just dig everywhere, you’ll probably mess things up, waste your energy, and never find the treasure. Same thing goes with pentesting—**map the infrastructure** first, understand the setup, and then carefully plan your next steps.

## Core Questions to Ask During Enumeration

These questions help guide us during the enumeration process in any situation:

**What can we see?**

**What reasons can we have for seeing it?**

**What image does what we see create for us?**

**What do we gain from it?**

**How can we use it?**

**What can we not see?**

**What reasons can there be that we do not see?**

**What image results for us from what we do not see?**

Even the things we **cannot** see are important and might give us clues. As we gain more experience, we start to notice these invisible elements and use them to our advantage.

Also, just a heads up: there are always **exceptions to the rules**, but the **principles themselves never change**.

### Final Note

These principles are not just theory—they’re super helpful when we’re stuck. Most of the time, it’s **not our pentesting skills that fail**, but our **technical understanding** of the system. We should write down these principles and questions somewhere we can always see them and refer back to them whenever we need to.
