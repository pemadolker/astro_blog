## Overview of MySQL

- **What is MySQL?**  
  MySQL is a widely-used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle. It is designed to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. MySQL is often used in web applications due to its speed, reliability, and ease of use.

- **Architecture**  
  MySQL follows a client-server model. The MySQL server manages the database, while MySQL clients (applications or users) send requests to the server for operations like data retrieval or modification.

## MySQL Clients

- **Role**: MySQL clients allow users to interact with the MySQL database by executing SQL commands. These clients can be command-line tools, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), or applications.
  
- **Common Use**: Websites and apps like WordPress, which depend on databases for content storage and user management, commonly use MySQL.

## Working with MySQL Databases

- **High Performance**: MySQL is optimized for speed and is a great choice for applications that require fast data processing, like dynamic websites.
  
- **Data Storage**: It stores structured data, such as user profiles, transaction records, and encrypted passwords, making it suitable for both small and large-scale applications.

## Common MySQL Commands

- **Basic Commands**:
  - `SHOW DATABASES;`: Displays all available databases.
  - `USE <database>;`: Switches to the specified database.
  - `SHOW TABLES;`: Lists all tables within the selected database.
  - `SELECT * FROM <table>;`: Retrieves all records from a specified table.

- **Database Manipulation**:
  - `INSERT INTO <table> (columns) VALUES (values);`: Adds new data to a table.
  - `UPDATE <table> SET column = value WHERE condition;`: Modifies existing data.

## Default MySQL Configuration

- **Configuration File**: MySQL settings are managed in `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`.
  
- **Example Configuration**:
  ```bash
  [client]
  port = 3306
  socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

  [mysqld]
  user = mysql
  port = 3306
  datadir = /var/lib/mysql
