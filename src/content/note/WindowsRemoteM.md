## RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
RDP is used for remote access to Windows machines, typically via TCP port 3389. It works at the application layer, and a secure connection can be established using TLS/SSL. However, some systems may still allow weak encryption by default.

## WinRM (Windows Remote Management)
WinRM is a service that implements the WS-Management protocol for hardware management and remote server control. It also supports PowerShell remote management.

## WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)
WMI allows administrators to access and manage hardware and software on Windows systems remotely.

## Key Points in the RDP Scan
- **NLA (Network Level Authentication)**: The server is using CredSSP (with NLA) for authentication, which is a more secure authentication method for RDP.
- **Encryption Information**: The server supports CredSSP and RDSTLS encryption, ensuring that the RDP session is secured.
- **Service Version**: The system is running Windows Server 2019 (version 10.0.17763).

## Scanning with Nmap
You're using Nmap to gather information about the RDP service running on the target system:
- The `-sV` option checks for service versions.
- The `-sC` flag runs Nmap's default scripts for service discovery, like `rdp-enum-encryption` and `rdp-ntlm-info`, which provide details about the encryption used and the target system.
- The `--packet-trace` option allows you to track the packet exchanges during the scan, providing a deeper view into the communication.
- The output from Nmap provides detailed information such as:
  - **RDP Encryption**: Successful CredSSP and RDSTLS encryption.
  - **Target Information**: Server name, NetBIOS name, and DNS info.
  - **NTLM Info**: Identifying the system as `ILF-SQL-01`, and showing NTLM authentication data, including domain and system details.

## Security Checks and Tools
- **rdp-sec-check.pl**: A Perl script developed by Cisco CX Security Labs, designed to check the security settings of RDP servers based on the handshakes and other security parameters. You installed the necessary dependencies and cloned the repository to use this script to analyze the RDP service on the target.

- **Using Packet Tracing**: By using `--packet-trace` during the scan, you can observe the detailed interaction between Nmap and the RDP server, including information like the RDP cookies (`mstshash=nmap`) that could be used to track or block malicious activity by security systems like EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response).

## Recommendations
- **Encryption Weakness**: Although RDP supports TLS encryption, you should ensure that it is enforced and that self-signed certificates are replaced with trusted ones to avoid vulnerabilities related to certificate validation.
- **Monitoring and Detection**: Be mindful that scanning tools like Nmap can be detected by security services. Consider using techniques that avoid detection, like changing the user-agent or disabling certain scripts that might trigger alarms.
